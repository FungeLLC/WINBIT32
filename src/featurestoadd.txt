Basic Idea: Pay with whatever you have as whatever someone wants.
Automated as much as possible.
No Click Payments.
Integration plugins.

Part Done:
Private EthBtc auto conversions
Fee calculations for max transfer 
QR code reading 
Stablecoin destination
"pay me" links 

Soon (in no real order):
enable streaming swaps
same/same token handling
Hosted version "On-Chain" (but not strictly decentralised - permits swaps after browser closed)
Callback on transaction complete (and other steps)
API (access control by token? Airdrop to prev users?) 
Other chains 
Other ETH tokens (with permissions)
Plugins for shopify, woocommerce, chrome. 
Bots: telegram, x
Address book for when logged in by PWA or wallet. 
Triggers (webhook, price(Inc gas) , time) 
multiple receivers
Multiple inputs
Metamask/walletconnect connections


Future:
Saving and Lending in one interface. Perhaps "amplify" rather than lending?
